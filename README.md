# Comments and Recommendations
#### The business recorded a fast growth in its first four years in the market by making a remarkable Profit Margin of 12.5%.
#### However, there was a great decline in profit in 2018 which on observation was said to be from the fact that there was a sharp decline in the number of items ordered and shipped across the country in 2018.
#### The Company should carry out a customer survey to get customer satisfaction feedback. It could help to know the reason why there was a fall in the number of items ordered in 2018.
